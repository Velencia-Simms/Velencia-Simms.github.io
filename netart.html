<br>

  <h2>Obsession Time<h2><br>
  <p>My hobbies are mainly digital so that's definitely why I changed my major to New Media Tech.<br>
   My major used to be biology but bio sucks, man. <br>
   I mean, hell yeah to the people pursuing bio i'm proud of you live your dreams but I can't. <br>
   RIP to past me who thought bio was the only option because it was the one thing mildly interesting back in high school but i'm different. <br>
   Anyways, hobbies. The big two are drawing and video editing. For example: <br>
